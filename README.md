- I love to code in **C++**
- I love to code in **Lisp**

- I dont like emacs lisp much, but i have to use emacs lisp because Im a emacs user.
- I dont like python because its slow, but i have to use it on my job.
- I hate to code in java, but its my job too and i want avoid it whenever its possible.
- Never ever, Perl :(
