## Something about me

- I love to code in **C++**
- I love to code in real **Lisp**
- I love to tweak with **Assembler** (x86,AMD64,..)
---
- I dont like emacs lisp much, but i have to use emacs lisp because Im a emacs user.
- I dont like python because its slow, but i have to use it on my job.
- I hate to code in java, but its my job too and i want avoid it whenever its possible.

Here on github I publish my private repos I created just for fun.
